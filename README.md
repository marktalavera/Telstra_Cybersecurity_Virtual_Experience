# Telstra Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program

## Hands-on experience as a Security Analyst

This job simulation details my participation in Telstra's Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program, where I simulated the role of an Information Security Analyst within their Security Operations Centre (SOC). The program provided a realistic experience in handling a malware attack.

### Task: Mitigating a Malware Attack (CVE-2022-22965) on nbn Services

- Triage and Response: I assessed a simulated malware attack targeting Telstra's nbn services. This involved prioritizing the threat, analyzing its impact, and potentially isolating compromised systems.
- Malware Analysis: I delved into the technical aspects of the malware to understand its infection and propagation methods. This knowledge was critical in developing a mitigation strategy.
- Python Scripting for Firewall Rule Creation: Based on the malware analysis, I created a Python script to implement a firewall rule. This rule most likely blocks connections from the identified malicious source, effectively stopping the malware spread.
- Incident Postmortem Report: I documented the entire incident response process, including the attack details, my analysis, and the implemented remediation steps. This report serves as valuable reference material for future security improvements.


### Key Learning:

-	Practical application of cybersecurity concepts in a simulated SOC environment.
-	The importance of incident triage and prioritization for effective response.
-	Malware analysis techniques for identifying infection vectors.
-	Scripting skills for automating security measures using Python.
-	The significance of post-incident documentation for continuous security improvement.


## Steps
This project showcases my ability to:
-	Apply security best practices in a simulated real-world scenario.
-	Think critically and analytically to solve security problems.
-	Work independently and collaboratively to achieve security objectives.
-	Possess strong technical skills, including Python scripting.
-	Maintain a meticulous documentation process for future reference.

This experience has solidified my interest in cybersecurity and my desire to pursue a career in this field.
